Followed a Udemy course ðŸ˜… - made some adjustments such as folder structure, naming scheme, and HTML tag to my liking. 

Utilized `Next.js 13`, `Directus`, `Tailwind`. Special thanks to `ChatGPT` for generating those blog content!

I stopped paying Railway for the database and Directus service though.
